# Usage Page LiteLLM Integration - Implementation Summary

## Problem
The usage page was not displaying any data even though usage existed in LiteLLM. The backend was querying a local `usage_logs` table that had no data, while actual usage was being tracked in LiteLLM.

## Root Cause
LiteMaaS was designed to track usage locally in the `usage_logs` table, but:
1. No mechanism existed to populate this table
2. API calls were made directly to LiteLLM, bypassing LiteMaaS
3. Usage data remained in LiteLLM and was never synced to the local database

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added LiteLLM Usage Endpoint Integration
**File**: `backend/src/services/litellm.service.ts`
- Added `getUserDailyActivity()` method to fetch usage data from LiteLLM's `/user/daily/activity` endpoint
- Implements caching and mock data support for development
- Properly formats query parameters for the LiteLLM API

### 2. Updated Usage Stats Service
**File**: `backend/src/services/usage-stats.service.ts`
- Modified `getUsageStats()` to check if `apiKeyId` is provided
- When API key is specified, fetches data from LiteLLM instead of local database
- Transforms LiteLLM response format to match the expected frontend format
- Falls back to local database if LiteLLM fetch fails

### 3. Data Transformation
The integration transforms LiteLLM data to the expected format:
- Maps `api_requests` to `totalRequests`
- Maps `total_tokens`, `prompt_tokens`, `completion_tokens` appropriately
- Creates model breakdown from `by_model` array
- Generates time series data by distributing usage across the date range
- Provides sensible defaults for metrics not available from LiteLLM (latency, error rates)

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend**: User selects an API key from the dropdown
2. **Backend**: Receives request with `apiKeyId` and authenticated `userId`
3. **Usage Stats Service**: 
   - Detects API key filter is present
   - Calls LiteLLM service to fetch user's daily activity
   - Transforms the data to expected format
4. **Frontend**: Displays the usage statistics from LiteLLM

## Benefits
- No need to modify the frontend (except the API key selector already added)
- Uses real usage data from LiteLLM
- Maintains backward compatibility with local database approach
- Provides graceful fallback if LiteLLM is unavailable

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- The integration properly handles date formatting
- Mock data is available for development mode

# Frontend environment variables are not needed anymore
# The frontend container is configured at runtime using the BACKEND_URL environment variable
# 
# For local development, the Vite dev server proxies /api requests to the backend
# as configured in vite.config.ts
#
# For production deployments, set BACKEND_URL when running the container:
# docker run -e BACKEND_URL=https://api.yourdomain.com litemaas-frontend

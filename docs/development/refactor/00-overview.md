## Overall Purpose

This master plan provides a detailed, phased implementation strategy for addressing all issues identified in the comprehensive code review of the Admin Usage Analytics feature. The plan is designed for multi-session execution with clear priorities, checkpoints, and validation criteria.

**Key Principles**:

1. **Quality First**: Full test coverage maintained at all times
2. **Incremental Progress**: Each session produces a working, tested increment
3. **Clear Checkpoints**: Validation between phases ensures stability
4. **Documentation**: Update docs as we go, not at the end
5. **Rollback Ready**: Each commit is atomic and revertible

## Multi-Session Execution Strategy

### Session Types

#### Short Sessions (2-3 hours)

**Best For**:

- Single, focused issues (#2, #4, #5, #14, #15)
- Quick wins with clear scope
- Time-constrained work periods

**Examples**:

- Fix ResizeObserver leak (Session 1C)
- Add date range validation (Session 1B)
- Remove console statements (Session 4D)

#### Medium Sessions (4-6 hours)

**Best For**:

- Complex issues requiring design (#6, #7, #8, #9)
- Multiple related changes
- Full work blocks

**Examples**:

- Add rate limiting (Session 1A)
- Backend pagination (Session 2A)
- Timezone standardization (Session 3B)

#### Long Sessions (8-16 hours)

**Best For**:

- Major refactoring (#1, #10)
- Can be split into sub-sessions
- Requires sustained focus

**Examples**:

- Service file refactoring (Sessions 1E-1H)
- Performance testing (Session 5B)

**Note**: Long sessions should be broken into logical sub-sessions with commit points.

2. ‚úÖ All tests passing (100%)
3. ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors
4. ‚úÖ Linter passing
5. ‚úÖ Documentation updated
6. ‚úÖ Code reviewed (if team process)
7. ‚úÖ Deployed to staging (if applicable)

**If Any Gate Fails**:

## Risk Mitigation

### Common Risks and Mitigations

1. **Test Failures After Refactoring**
   - **Mitigation**: Run tests after each small change, commit frequently
   - **Recovery**: Revert to last working commit, fix issues

2. **Performance Regression**
   - **Mitigation**: Benchmark before/after, test with realistic data
   - **Recovery**: Optimize or rollback problematic changes

3. **Scope Creep**
   - **Mitigation**: Stick to plan, log new ideas for later
   - **Recovery**: Prioritize ruthlessly, defer non-critical items

4. **Time Overruns**
   - **Mitigation**: Track actual vs. estimated time, adjust plan
   - **Recovery**: Re-prioritize, consider skipping Phase 6

5. **Breaking Changes in Dependencies**
   - **Mitigation**: Pin dependency versions, test upgrades in isolation
   - **Recovery**: Rollback dependencies, investigate alternatives

### Rollback Strategy

**Protocol**:

1. **Stop work** - Don't compound the problem
2. **Assess impact** - What's broken?
3. **Review last commit** - Can we fix forward or must we rollback?
4. **Rollback if needed** - Use `git revert` for shared branches
5. **Document issue** - What went wrong and why?
6. **Update plan** - Adjust approach for next attempt

**Rollback Commands**:

```bash
# Undo last commit (keep changes)
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Undo last commit (discard changes)
git reset --hard HEAD~1

# Revert commit on shared branch
git revert <commit-hash>

# Return to last checkpoint
git checkout <phase-checkpoint-tag>
```

## Overview

Phase 0 establishes the foundation for successful remediation by setting up the environment, establishing baseline metrics, and verifying all prerequisites are in place.

**Objectives**:

1. Set up development environment
2. Create feature branch for remediation work
3. Establish baseline metrics (performance, code quality)
4. Verify test suite is working
5. Document current state
6. Set up tracking and monitoring

---

## Pre-requisites

Before starting Phase 0:

- [ ] Access to development environment
- [ ] Access to git repository with commit permissions
- [ ] Node.js and npm installed (versions matching project)
- [ ] PostgreSQL database access
- [ ] Code editor configured
- [ ] Chrome DevTools for memory profiling
- [ ] Issue tracker access

---

## Setup Steps

### Step 0.1: Environment Verification (30 minutes)

**Verify Development Environment**:

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version
# Expected: v20.x or higher (check package.json engines)

# Check npm version
npm --version
# Expected: 10.x or higher

# Check PostgreSQL access
psql --version
# Expected: PostgreSQL 14+

# Verify project dependencies
cd /home/gmoutier/Dev/repos/rh-aiservices-bu/litemaas
npm install
npm --prefix backend install
npm --prefix frontend install

# Verify development servers can start
npm run dev:logged
# Expected: Backend on :8081, Frontend on :3000
# Stop with Ctrl+C after verification
```

**Verify Git Configuration**:

```bash
# Check git user
git config user.name
git config user.email

# Check current branch
git branch --show-current
# Expected: refactor (or create it in next step)

# Check remote
git remote -v
# Expected: origin pointing to rh-aiservices-bu/litemaas
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Node.js version correct
- [ ] npm version correct
- [ ] PostgreSQL accessible
- [ ] Dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Development servers start without errors
- [ ] Git configured correctly

---

### Step 0.2: Create Feature Branch (15 minutes)

**Create dedicated branch for remediation work**:

```bash
# Ensure you're on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create feature branch
git checkout -b refactor/admin-analytics-remediation

# Push branch to remote
git push -u origin refactor/admin-analytics-remediation
```

**Branch Naming Convention**:

- Prefix: `refactor/`
- Purpose: `admin-analytics-remediation`
- This branch will contain all remediation work across all phases

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Feature branch created
- [ ] Branch pushed to remote
- [ ] Currently on feature branch

---

### Step 0.3: Establish Baseline Metrics (45 minutes)

#### Code Quality Metrics

**Run Existing Tests**:

```bash
# Backend tests
npm --prefix backend test
# Record: Total tests, passing, failing, coverage %

# Frontend tests
npm --prefix frontend test
# Record: Total tests, passing, failing, coverage %
```

**Record Baseline**:

Create `docs/development/refactor/baseline-metrics.md`:

````markdown
# Baseline Metrics - Admin Analytics Remediation

npm --prefix backend test -- admin-usage

# If tests fail, document failures
# Do not fix yet - just document current state
````

**Test Coverage Analysis**:

```bash
# Generate coverage report
npm --prefix backend test -- --coverage

# Open coverage report
# backend/coverage/lcov-report/index.html
```

**Document Test Gaps**:

In `baseline-metrics.md`, add:

```markdown
## Test Coverage Details

### Admin Usage Stats Service

- Line Coverage: [X]%
- Branch Coverage: [Y]%
- Function Coverage: [Z]%

### Known Test Gaps

- [ ] Rate limiting (not yet implemented)
- [ ] Date range validation edge cases
- [ ] Memory leak tests
- [ ] Migration rollback procedures
- [ ] Timezone handling
- [ ] Race condition scenarios
```

**Checklist**:

- [ ] Admin analytics tests run
- [ ] Coverage report generated
- [ ] Test gaps documented
- [ ] Baseline test metrics recorded

### Step 0.5: Create Progress Tracking (30 minutes)

**Set Up Issue Tracker**:

If using GitHub Issues or similar:

1. Create milestone: "Admin Analytics Remediation"
2. Create issues for each phase (or use existing from code review)
3. Link issues to this plan
4. Set up labels: `phase-0`, `phase-1`, `critical`, `high-priority`, etc.

**Create Progress Log**:

Create `docs/development/refactor/progress-log.md`:

```markdown
# Admin Analytics Remediation - Progress Log

## Phase 0: Preparation

**Started**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: 🟦 In Progress

## Notes

**Important Considerations**:

1. **Don't fix issues yet** - Phase 0 is about documentation and preparation only
2. **Capture current state accurately** - These metrics will validate progress
3. **Set up for success** - Good tracking now saves time later
4. **Communicate with team** - Share baseline findings before starting Phase 1

**Tips for Success**:

- Take time to understand current state fully
- Document everything - future you will thank you
- Verify test suite is reliable before making changes
- Establish clear metrics to measure progress
- Set up tracking tools now, not later

---

**Phase 0 Sign-Off**:

- [ ] All validation criteria met
- [ ] Baseline metrics reviewed
- [ ] Team aligned on priorities (if applicable)
- [ ] Ready to proceed to Phase 1

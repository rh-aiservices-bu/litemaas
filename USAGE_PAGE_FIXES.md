# Usage Page API Key Integration - Implementation Summary

## Overview
The usage page has been updated to display usage statistics filtered by API keys. Users can now select which API key they want to view statistics for using a dropdown selector.

## Changes Made

### 1. Frontend - UsagePage.tsx
- **Added API Key State Management**:
  - `apiKeys`: Array to store user's API keys
  - `selectedApiKey`: Currently selected API key ID
  - `isApiKeyOpen`: Dropdown open state
  - `loadingApiKeys`: Loading state for API keys

- **Added API Key Loading**:
  - `loadApiKeys()` function to fetch user's API keys
  - Auto-selects first API key if available
  - Proper error handling with notifications

- **Updated Usage Metrics Loading**:
  - Modified `loadUsageMetrics()` to filter by selected API key
  - Early return if no API key is selected
  - Includes `apiKeyId` in the filters

- **Added API Key Dropdown**:
  - Placed in toolbar before date range selector
  - Shows API key names
  - Disabled state when loading or no keys available
  - Proper loading and empty states

- **Enhanced Empty States**:
  - Shows different messages when no API key is selected
  - Provides "Create API Key" button when user has no keys
  - Provides "Select API Key" button when keys exist but none selected

### 2. Translations Added
Added the following translation keys to `frontend/src/i18n/locales/en/translation.json`:
- `loadingApiKeys`: "Loading API Keys..."
- `noApiKeys`: "No API Keys"
- `selectApiKey`: "Select API Key"
- `noApiKeysTitle`: "No API Keys Found"
- `noApiKeysDescription`: "Create an API key to start tracking your usage statistics."
- `selectApiKeyTitle`: "Select an API Key"
- `selectApiKeyDescription`: "Please select an API key from the dropdown above to view its usage statistics."
- `createApiKey`: "Create API Key"
- `apiKeysLoadError`: "Failed to Load API Keys"
- `apiKeysLoadErrorDesc`: "Unable to retrieve your API keys. Please refresh the page or try again later."

## Data Flow
1. **On Page Load**:
   - Fetch all user's API keys
   - Auto-select first key if available
   - Load usage metrics for selected key

2. **On API Key Selection**:
   - Update selected API key state
   - Reload usage metrics with new filter

3. **On Date Range Change**:
   - Reload metrics for selected API key with new date range

4. **Export Function**:
   - Includes selected API key in export filters

## Backend
No backend changes were required as the existing `/usage/metrics` endpoint already supports filtering by `apiKeyId`.

## Testing
- TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- The implementation follows PatternFly 6 patterns
- Proper error handling and loading states implemented

## [0.1.2] - 2025-10-17

This patch release fixes a critical database migration issue that could prevent successful deployments.

### Fixed

- **Database Migration Resilience**: Fixed `litellm_key_alias` backfill migration to skip inactive API keys
  - Migration now filters for `is_active = true` to avoid processing inactive/revoked keys
  - Prevents 404 errors from LiteLLM when trying to fetch details for deleted keys
  - Eliminates circuit breaker opening after 5 consecutive failures
  - Ensures active keys are successfully processed during backfill operations
  - Added explanatory comment about skipping inactive keys

## [0.1.1] - 2025-10-17

This patch release improves test reliability, server startup performance, and handles edge cases in database migrations.

### Fixed

- **Orphaned API Key Handling**: Backend now gracefully handles API keys that exist in the database but were deleted in LiteLLM
  - Database migration marks orphaned keys with `orphaned_` prefix instead of failing
  - Eliminates verbose error logging during backfill operations
  - Prevents migration failures due to missing keys in LiteLLM
  - Improved error handling for 404 responses during key synchronization

- **Server Startup Performance**: Backend initialization is now faster and more resilient
  - Moved LiteLLM-dependent operations to background tasks using `setImmediate`
  - Server starts immediately without waiting for external service operations
  - Non-blocking initialization prevents startup delays
  - Better handling of external service availability during boot

- **Frontend Test Reliability**: Fixed missing mock endpoint causing test failures
  - Added `/api/v1/banners` mock endpoint to test handlers
  - BannerProvider now works correctly in Layout component tests
  - Eliminated test failures related to banner initialization

- **Configuration**: Minor backend configuration adjustments
  - Updated admin analytics configuration handling
  - Package dependency updates

### Documentation
